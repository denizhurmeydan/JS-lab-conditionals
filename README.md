## Activity: Grade Calculator

Create a program that calculates the grade of a student based on their score in a test. The program should assign a score to a variable, then use if-else statements to assign a grade based on the following scale:

- A: 90-100
- B: 80-89
- C: 70-79
- D: 60-69
- F: below 60

After assigning a grade, the program should display the grade to the user using the `console.log` function.

### Example Output

`Your score is 85, Your grade is B`


### Requirements

- The program should assign a score to a variable using an integer data type.
- The program should use if-else statements to assign a grade based on the score and store it in a variable.
- The program should display the score and grade to the user using the `console.log` function.

### Bonus

- Refactor the if-else and use Switch instead.
